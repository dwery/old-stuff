<BR>
PicProbe is a logic three-state-capable probe and may be downloaded
and used for free. Any commercial use is forbidden .
I've only tested it on a 16C84 but i'm sure it can be easily ported to 
other pic types. 
<BR>
Plase read the docs in the archive and email me your suggestions,
improvments, portings, bugfixes, etc etc etc.
<BR>
Please email me if you've succesfully builted my PicProbe.
