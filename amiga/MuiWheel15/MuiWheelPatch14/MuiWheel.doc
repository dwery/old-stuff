Introduction
------------

 MuiWheel is a complex patch to allow some classes
 of the Magic User Interface to react correctly
 to your mouse wheel movements. It includes
 a MuiWheel.mcp class to set up the preferences.
 If you don't have a wheeled mouse, this program
 will not be useful to you, if you don't
 even know what a wheeled mouse is, go
 to the LogiTech homepage, i'm sure you
 will buy one soon. For more informations
 download NewMouse from Aminet.

 Please *READ* this doc before using it.

 The following classes will be patched:

 - Cycle.mui
 - Numeric.mui (Slider.mui, Knob.mui, Numericbutton.mui, ...)
 - List.mui
 - Prop.mui
 - Virtgroup.mui (Scrollgroup.mui)

Upgrading from version 1.0
--------------------------

 Follow the "Installation and Usage" chapter, just remember 
 that the patch for muimaster.library is NO MORE NEEDED,
 so you can copy the original muimaster.library in place.
 You should then set the new preferences with the MUI preferences 
 editor, since you can now enable/disable every single patch.
 Oh.. a postcard will be appreciated :-)


Installation and Usage
----------------------

 MuWheelPatch needs to be loaded only one time. Anyway,
 a check is made, so you can't do anything dangerous if you
 run it twice.

 To install the patch, simply copy MuiWheelPatch in your C: directory
 and add the relative call somewhere
 in your s:startup-sequence, but BEFORE any other program
 that uses MUI is launched. The standard MUI assignment
 section is a good place.

 Example:

  ...somewhere in your startup-sequence...

  C:Run <>NIL: C:MuiWheelPatch

 or

  if exists ......
   assign MUI: ......
   if exists MUI:Libs
      assign add LIBS: MUI:Libs
   endif
   if exists MUI:Locale
      assign add LOCALE: MUI:Locale
   endif
   version >nil: exec.library 39
   if not warn
      if exists MUI:Docs
         if exists HELP:dummy ; do not remove
         endif                ; this entry!
         assign add HELP: MUI:Docs
      endif
   endif
   C:Run <>NIL: C:MuiWheelPatch ; MUI has got the wheel!
  endif


 Now you should copy the given MuiWheel.mcp class 
 to MUI:Libs/mui/ 

 Remember that MuiWheelPatch will not work with versions of 
 muimaster.library other than 19. As far as i can tell you
 the wheel support will be added in the next MUI release.

 Obviously you *NEED* a MouseWheel
 compatible *mouse* *driver*, such as NewMouse.

 You're now ready to run. Reboot your system
 and start MUI:MUI to set the preferences.

 PLEASE NOTE that due to the particular nature of this
 patch, even if the new preferences are updated
 on-the-fly, the "Test" gadget in the MUI preferences
 does not work. 


Future

 I'm waiting for suggestions...(and postcards too..) :-)
