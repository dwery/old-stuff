LayGroup.mcc is a subclass of Virtgroup.mui that allows
you to easily layout objects in a variable space.
The user can change some settings trough LayGroup.mcp.
You can see the LayGroup-Demo to better understand this 
class. Starting with version 19.2, you can use
every object as a child of this class, even if they
have different vertical/horizontal sizes. 
LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_Group_SameSize

    NAME
        MUIA_Group_SameSize -- (V19.2) [I.], BOOL

    FUNCTION
        Set this if and only if you children's

        meaning isn't the same. Be careful.

LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_LayGroup_HorizSpacing

    NAME
        MUIA_LayGroup_HorizSpacing -- [ISG], WORD

    FUNCTION
        This attribute is used to choice
        the horizontal spacing between two 
        objects. Using this attribute will
        override the user's settings.
LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_LayGroup_VertSpacing 

    NAME

    FUNCTION
        This attribute is used to choice
        the vertical spacing between two 
        objects. Using this attribute will
        override the user's settings.

    NAME
        MUIA_LayGroup_Spacing -- [IS.], WORD

    FUNCTION
        This attribute is used to choice
        both horizontal and vertical spacing
        between two  objects. Using this attribute 
        will override the user's settings.
LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_LayGroup_LeftOffset  

    NAME

    FUNCTION
        This attribute is used to choice
        the left offset between the object 
        and its children. Using this attribute 
        will override the user's settings.
LayGroup.mcc/MUIA_LayGroup_TopOffset  

    NAME

        the top offset between the object 
        and its children. Using this attribute 
        will override the user's settings.
LayGroup.mcc/MUIM_LayGroup_AskLayout

    NAME
        MUIM_LayGroup_AskLayout (V19.2)

    SYSNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj, MUIM_LayGroup_AskLayout, struct MUI_LayGroup_Layout *lgl);

    FUNCTION
        If MUIA_LayGroup_AskLayout is TRUE and MUIA_Group_SameSize
        is FALSE, this method will be called to let the subclass
        choice the width and height of an object.

    INPUTS
        lgl - a MUI_LayGroup_Layout structure:
            lgl_Object    - The object under examination
            lgl_Height  - It's height.
            lgl_Width     - It's width
    
    RESULT
        Always return 0 for now.

    NOTES
        This method is for subclass authors only and therefore
        should not be called directly.

    EXAMPLE
        This is the default implementation of this method
        within LayGroup.mcc
        
            ULONG ASM _AskLayout(REG(a0) struct IClass *cl, REG(a2) Object *obj, REG(a1) struct MUIP_LayGroup_AskLayout *al)
            {                                                                                  
                (al->lgl)->lgl_Width     = _defwidth ((al->lgl)->lgl_Object);
                (al->lgl)->lgl_Height     = _defheight((al->lgl)->lgl_Object);
        
                return(0);
            }
